  caption: Human learning and reasoning is founded on multiple knowledge representations
    with different kinds of structures, such as trees, chains, dominance hierarchies,
    neighborhood graphs, and directed networks. This class uses probabilistic inference
    methods from machine learning and Bayesian statistics, operating over different
    kinds of structured representational systems, to explain how people's domain knowledge
    can support a wide range of learning and reasoning tasks, and how these knowledge
    structures may themselves be learned from experience. (Image by Prof. Joshua Tenenbaum.)
