description: 'This file explains how recent work in computation (AI, machine learning,
  statistics) can inform some of the core questions of cognitive science. It also
  includes the following topics:

  The problem of induction, induction versus Deduction, the great problem of philosophy,
  computational approaches to induction, structure versus statistics, cognition as
  inductive inference, learning concepts and words from examples, visual perception,
  apparent motion, Marr''s three levels, some philosophical puzzles, Hume''s problem,
  Goodman''s problem, syntactic levers for induction, the legacy of Plato, Fodor''s
  critique, and how do theories work.'
